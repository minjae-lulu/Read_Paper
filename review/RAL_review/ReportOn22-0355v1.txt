This paper proposed a self-supervised dataset generation method for
multi-object pose estimation. 

Reviewer 1 finds the method of interest, in particular the
self-annotated dataset that is not bound by the teacher network. The
main concern is that the self annotated dataset is limited by the
presence of moving objects, pose drift, occlusions and matching
problems. The moving object handling was found to be unclear. The
performance improvements were found to be minor, suggesting that other
significant factors need to be considered.

Reviewer 2 finds the topic of interest but that the effectiveness of
the proposed method to address scalability is questionable. The article
does not provide enough evaluation of objects not included in the
original dataset. The reviewer asks that the authors clarify the
technical contributions and experimental evaluation in terms of the
scalability but finds that the methods improves pose estimation
precision.

Based on the reviews it would seem that the paper is not yet ready for
publication. The claim that scalability is crucial for pose estimation
remains limited by the evaluation. The authors may need to revise this
claim and/or address other issues that limit performance.
